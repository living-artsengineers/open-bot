# LAE OpenBot

**This is Living ArtsEngine's collaborative Discord bot project.** From quote tracking to course lookups, many custom bot features are valuable to LAE and U-M students in general. This project is our place to learn, ideate, and develop these features for the Living ArtsEngine community. All LAE members are welcome to submit issues, merge requests, and feature requests.

Just figuring out how to use the OpenBot? Check out the [docs](docs/README.md).

## Getting Started

We're using Python because it's widely used, mostly unsurprising (unlike some parts of [JavaScript](https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs)), and beginner-friendly. Fork this repository, clone your fork, and do the following:

1. Get [`pdm`](https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/) if not already installed
1. Run `pdm install` to install dependencies
1. Check out [existing modules](mod/) for examples
1. Code your module, and add it to [mod/\_\_init\_\_.py](mod/__init__.py)
1. Run `black` to format your code
1. Start a Merge Request into the main branch
